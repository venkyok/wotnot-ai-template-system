# 📋 Docker Removed - Use Cloud Deployment

## Why Docker was removed:
- Build context issues causing deployment failures
- Complex setup for local development
- Cloud deployment is faster and more reliable

## ✅ Recommended Deployment:

### 🚂 Railway (Backend)
- Automatic Python environment setup
- Built-in health monitoring
- Environment variables management
- SQLite database included

### 🌐 Vercel (Frontend)
- Automatic Vue.js build and deploy
- CDN distribution worldwide
- SSL certificates included
- Environment variable support

## 🚀 Deploy in 5 minutes:

1. **Railway**: Import GitHub repo → Set environment variables → Deploy
2. **Vercel**: Import same repo → Set root directory to `frontend/app` → Deploy

See `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` for detailed deployment instructions.

## Local Development (No Docker needed):

### Backend:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn wati.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend/app
npm install
npm run serve
```

Your app will work perfectly without Docker! 🎉
