# Railway Deployment Configuration
# This file helps Railway detect the project structure

# Backend is in the 'backend' directory
# Frontend is in the 'frontend/app' directory

# For Railway deployment:
# 1. Set root directory to 'backend' in Railway dashboard
# 2. Or deploy backend as a separate service
