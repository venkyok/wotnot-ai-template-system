The Vue template is broken. Here's what we need to do:

1. The AI response is being generated successfully (we have the backend working)
2. The issue is the template structure is broken from our edits
3. We need to restore a clean template

The key working parts:
- generateCRMTemplate() method works
- setDraftPreview() method works  
- The response is in this.generatedTemplatePreview

The simple fix is to show the AI response in a visible location without breaking the template.

Let me just put it in the input field temporarily so you can see it's working, then we'll fix the proper preview display.
